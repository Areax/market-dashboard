"""Self-computed replica of CME FedWatch's "Aggregated" view: for each
upcoming FOMC meeting, the cumulative probability of each possible target
rate range, derived from 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices.

CME's own description of "Aggregated": it "compares the rates implied by
CME's Fed Funds futures with the CURRENT target rate range... a view into
the cumulative number of hikes or cuts the market is pricing by a certain
point in the future." That's a direct one-shot comparison of each future
month's contract against today's rate — not a meeting-to-meeting tree. (An
earlier attempt using the open-source `pyfedwatch` library, which builds a
full combinatorial tree across meetings, did NOT reproduce CME's numbers —
that's their separate "Conditional" view. This module was reverse-engineered
and validated against a real CME FedWatch screenshot instead.)

Data, all free and license-clean:
  - 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices (ZQ contracts): Yahoo Finance. These
    trade on CME's own exchange (CME Globex) — Yahoo doesn't estimate them,
    it redistributes the same exchange data. Verified to match CME's own
    displayed prices to the tick.
  - Current EFFR + target rate band, and a fallback for already-expired
    contract months Yahoo has delisted: FRED (official Fed data).

Known imprecision: for a meeting immediately followed by ANOTHER meeting the
next month (no clean gap month to read a single resolved rate from), the
resolved post-meeting rate has to be backed out from that shared month's own
blended price. Small rounding in the inputs (FRED EFFR is only published to
2 decimals) gets amplified there, worst-case by a few percentage points when
the true answer sits very close to 0% or 100%. Validated to be exact (within
0.1pt) on meetings that DO have a clean gap month, and within roughly 1-3pts
on the rest.
